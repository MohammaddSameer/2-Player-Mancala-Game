### Are the variable and method names meaningful and descriptive? Give specific examples to support your observation. How could the variable and method names be improved?


Overall, the code is relatively well-named, but small improvements could make it even more readable and maintainable



### Does the code follow coding conventions and formatting standards? Has it made appropriate use of includes? Are static members used properly? Give specific examples of how you would improve the coding conventions used.

While the code generally follows naming conventions, it's a good practice to use camelCase for method names and capitalize class names. The code lacks comments to explain the purpose of classes, methods, and complex logic. Adding comments can make the code more understandable and maintainable.
The code does not include error handling for invalid inputs, such as when a player attempts to make an illegal move.



### Are the classes properly encapsulated? Are member variables private? Are accessor and mutator methods used? How could you improve the encapsulation of this code?

The code demonstrates a degree of encapsulation by making member variables private, and it uses getters methods to access these private members.

### Is there any duplication of code in this project? Are there methods that do essentially the same thing, or parts of the same thing that could be made into smaller methods?



The code for printing the game board is duplicated in the MancalaGame class. You can create a separate method to handle the board printing, reducing redundancy.



### Does each class and method have a single, obvious purpose or responsibility? Are there any long methods that should be broken up into smaller methods? Give specific examples of how you could improve the code with respect to responsibilities.


The code provided does a reasonable job of organizing responsibilities into classes and methods, but there are opportunities for improvement in terms of ensuring that each class and method has a single, obvious purpose and responsibility. In 'Mancala Game ', The 'play' method, which handles a player's move, can be broken down into smaller methods responsible for different aspects of the move (e.g., distributing stones, capturing stones, checking for game over).
